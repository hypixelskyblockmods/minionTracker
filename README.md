Minion Tracker


  Minion Tracker's goal is to improve your Hypixel Skyblock expierence. Without help from others this would not be possible.
  
  First of all if you are helping with this project please follow the next steps.
  
  1. Make this mod avaible to be able to be used on Forge 1.8.9
  2. Make this mod have connections to Hypixel's API to allow Bazaar price tracking.
  3. Make this mod have a GUI with a few things.
         The GUI should open under the command /miniontracker
         This GUI should have an option to turn on or off bazaar tracking and turn on or off when you press tab you can see which minions are empty or full
               (Adding onto the one above when a minion is full a notification will pop up on the screen)
         This GUI should have a darkended stone brick GUI backscreen
         
 4. When opening a minion it will show the bazaar insta-sell and bazaar sell-order.
